# Over-the-wire-bandit-game
This is a repo of my journey in completing the overthewire bandit game where I will be providing solutions to each level.
This game tests your skills in the linux terminal by making you recall various commands to find the password to the next level.
The password is located in a file somewhere which you have to find like a puzzle.
There are 34 levels which will show you how good you really are at Linux!
I will show you how I completed 20 levels and annotate my thought process.
