#Due to the fact theres many directories we ware given a hint to search for a file that is human readable, exactly 1033 bytes in size and non executable
#The find command allows you to find files with many options so we use -type f(file), -size 1033c(bytes), ! -executable("!" prefix means non)
#This returns the file location which is a hidden file so we use ls -a or you can directly acces the file by cd and then ./.file2
